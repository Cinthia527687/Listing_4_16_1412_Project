This is my Addition Game Markdown

## Introduction:

Lets create a game. The user will be asked a simple math problem in the first round: to add two single digit numbers.
If the user gets this correct, they will be given points and asked a more difficult math problem in round 2, such as adding a pair of two digit numbers.
They will receive more points and be asked more difficult questions in the following round for every correct answer.
Every incorrect answer will be followed by a more simple question. There should be a total of 4 rounds.
At the end of 4 rounds, the code should print the final score. You may need case statements and the random method.
